We aim to provide a space where everyone feels comfortable discussing and learning mathematics, regardless of their academic background or their mathematical aptitude.

In this guide we will explore ways that helpers can help to create and champion a positive atmosphere.

## Dealing with difficulties

### Language barriers
While the main language of the server is English, we are a diverse community with users from all backgrounds. While it is nice when a question is asked in perfect English, be mindful that there are many reasons why a user may make mistakes or be unclear in their writing. They may speak English as a second language, be typing on a phone keyboard, or have a condition that makes it difficult for them to type.

If someone's writing is unclear, it is best to calmly and politely ask them if they can rephrase their question.

### Bad language
While it is not against server rules to use bad language, it may sometimes be frustrating to see. Remember that we are here to discuss and learn mathematics, not to correct each other's words and use of language. Unless their language use is making you very uncomfortable or is [breaking server rules](#unacceptable-behavior), try to ignore bad words and language and think about maybe [stepping back](#when-to-step-back).

### Rudeness
Not everyone has perfect manners. Some users are, unfortunately, rude to other users. It is rarely the case that calling users out on this improves the situation; worse still, being rude to a user who is being rude to you invariably leads to total breakdown in communication.

Nevertheless, it is extremely important not to automatically assume rudeness. Users may be from a different cultural background to you and/or have [language barriers](#language-barriers) that can sometimes make it very difficult to judge tone and intent. If you aren't sure, give users the benefit of the doubt.

## When things go wrong

### When to step back
There are times where, despite your best efforts, a troublesome user will continue to cause issues. In cases like these, it is often best for everyone involved that you take a step back and remove yourself from the situation. Always remember - you are volunteering to help somebody with their mathematics problems - not to put up with verbal abuse. If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, leave. Remember to use Discord's block tool to block users if you think it is appropriate.

### Unacceptable behavior
Unfortunately, there are occasions where users come to the server with the sole intent of causing problems, stirring up trouble, or otherwise trolling. While most bad behavior can be safely ignored, there are several things that are unacceptable to do or say on the server. For a full breakdown of unacceptable behaviors, please refer to [#rules](/rules){: .mention} and/or the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms){:target="_blank"}. If you see any of this type of behavior, you should ping <a class="mention">@Moderators</a> immediately and remove yourself from the situation.
