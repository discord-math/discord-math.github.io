Below is a list of reviews of books on probability theory.

**Lectures on Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics**\\
Tobago, M. (3rd Ed. 2017). *ISBN 9781981369195*.\\
*No prerequisites*

Freely available [here](https://www.statlect.com/){:target="_blank"}. It contains a fairly rigorous but accessible introduction to basic probability theory, common distributions, asymptotic theory, and fundamentals of statistics. It is fairly concise but offers section and chapter exercises. Works well as a supplement or first brush with the subject.

**Probability Essentials**\\
Jacod, J., Protter, P. (2nd Ed. 2004). *ISBN 9783540438717*.\\
*Prerequisites: introductory courses (or an equivalent) in linear algebra and real analysis*

A good and approachable choice for a beginner interested in self-studying measure theoretic probability. Any measure theory needed in the book is developed within it, but some exposure to measure theory beforehand wouldn't hurt either.
