**Field and Galois Theory**\\
Morandi, P. (1st Ed. 1996, GTM reprint 2011). *ISBN 9781461284758*.\\
*Largely self-contained introduction to field and Galois theory with minimal background requirements: working knowledge of ring theory and polynomials, some (finite) group theory and linear algebra. All prerequisites are covered in the appendix.*

Complete treatment of field and Galois theory with some things that might not be covered in a standard abstract algebra book: the last chapter covers transcendental extensions as they arise for example in algebraic geometry.
Contains a good collection of exercises.
